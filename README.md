# Maze-solving-Utility-based-agent
This repository has codes in java of a utility-based agent that is going to find an optimal path from initial position to goal position in any scenario. The algorithms implemented in the agent are breadth-first search, depth-first search, itertaive-deepening search, best-first search and A* search.
A1-in1, A1-tc1 - A1-tc7 are the test cases of the maze for the agent.
